# Project 2025

**Welcome to Project 2025, a project designed to learn how to test APIs, UI, and databases using Cypress and JavaScript.**  

## ðŸš€ Objective

This project aims to explore Cypress capabilities for automated testing at different levels:

* **API Testing**: Validation of RESTful endpoints.
* **UI Testing**: Interaction with the graphical user interface.
* **Database Testing**: Validation of stored and manipulated data.

Additionally, the project will be configured to integrate with GitHub Actions and/or Jenkins for test automation in CI/CD environments.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

* **Cypress** - Automated testing framework
* **JavaScript** - Main language for writing tests
* **Node.js** - Execution environment
* **GitHub Actions / Jenkins** - Test integration and automation
* **Cucumber** - To write tests in a format understandable to testers, developers and stakeholders

## ðŸ“Œ Installation

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/francoiturco/project2025.git).
2. Install dependencies running npm install in the terminal.

## ðŸš¦ Usage

* **Run UI Tests**: [work in progress]
* **Run API Tests**: [work in progress]
* **Run Database Tests**: [work in progress]

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Integration

This project can be integrated with GitHub Actions and Jenkins to run automated tests on every code change.

* **Example execution in GitHub Actions**: [work in progress]
* **Example execution in Jenkins**: [work in progress]

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas

* **Allure Report**
* **Tags for every type of test [API (CRUD, strcuture), SQL (CRUD, dataIntegrity), UI]**
* **Include Cucumber for UI tests**
